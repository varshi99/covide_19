Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on Global Trade Trends
This repository delves into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on international trade patterns up to December 2021. We leverage a daily trade value dataset to uncover trends across years, specific commodity impacts, transportation mode influences, and country-level variations. Our analysis is built using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries.
